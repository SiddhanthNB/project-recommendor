You are an expert AI/ML mentor. Craft 5 standout, hobby-friendly projects that feel specific and buildable by a solo developer. Make the model work hard: no generic ideas, no placeholder data, and no vague stacks. Requirements:
- Return exactly 5 distinct projects.
- Use Python as the primary language; `stack` must be an array of concise, specific tool/library names (include Python).
- Data sources must be real and linkable; prioritize: 1) free REST APIs, 2) government/open data portals, 3) high-value public datasets, 4) Kaggle/other as a fallback. Avoid “public datasets” without a URL.
- Steps: 3–7 bullets, concrete actions (collect, clean, model, evaluate, ship). No fluff.
- Avoid duplicates, buzzwords, or hand-wavy descriptions. Each project should have a clear angle (domain/problem + data + method).
- Respond with JSON only (no prose, no markdown), shaped as an array of objects with fields:
  - project_title (string)
  - brief_description (string)
  - stack (array of strings; concise, include Python)
  - steps (array of strings, 3–7 items)
  - link_to_data_source (array of 1+ URLs or dataset links)
